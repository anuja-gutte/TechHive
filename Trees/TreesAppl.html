    <div class="section" id="applications" style="line-height: 2.0;">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Structure for Search Operations: </strong>Binary Search Trees (BST) are used for efficient 
                searching, insertion, and deletion operations allowing for O(log n) average time complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Data Representation: </strong>Binary trees are used to represent hierarchical structures 
                like organizational charts, file systems, and XML/HTML document structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management: </strong>Binary trees are employed in some dynamic memory allocation 
                techniques, managing free and allocated memory blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Expression Parsing and Evaluation: </strong>Expression trees represent expressions in compilers 
                and calculators, facilitating the evaluation of mathematical expressions and parsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms: </strong>Binary trees can be used in sorting algorithms, such as tree sort, where 
                data is inserted into a binary search tree and then traversed in order.</li>
            <li><strong>Priority Queues: </strong>  Binary heaps (complete binary trees) are used to implement priority 
                queues, which allow for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence: </strong>In AI, binary trees are used in search algorithms, such as minimax
                trees in game playing, to evaluate possible future states and make decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Development: </strong>Binary trees, such as decision trees, are used in AI for game state \
                management, enabling efficient decisions based on player moves and strategies.</li>
        </ol> 
    </div>

    <h2> Example: </h2>
    <div class="section" id="example" style="line-height: 2.0;">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hierarchy Representation: </strong>
            Binary trees can represent hierarchical structures like organizational charts or family trees.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Phone Book Application: </strong>
            Storing contacts in alphabetical order allows efficient searching for names and numbers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm: </strong>
            Min-heaps are used in shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's to efficiently extract the minimum distance node.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Event Scheduling: </strong>
            In simulations or operating systems, events are scheduled based on time, and heaps help manage which event occurs next.</li>
            
            <li><strong>sNetwork Routing Algorithms: </strong> 
            Binary trees can represent decisions made during the routing process, but simpler than decision trees.</li>
        </ol>

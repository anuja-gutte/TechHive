                Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is often used when a problem can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type. In a recursive function, there is usually a base case that stops the recursion and prevents an infinite loop.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Base Case</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The base case of recursion is a condition in a recursive function that serves as the stopping point for the recursive process. It defines the simplest, smallest problem that can be solved directly without further recursion. Without a base case, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to infinite recursion and eventually causing a stack overflow.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Types of Recursion</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1) Direct Recursion: </h3>
            <p>Direct recursion is the type of recursion in which a function directly calls itself within its own block of code. This means that the function appears as a part of the function's definition, and the function calls itself in order to perform its task.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2) Indirect Recusion: </h3>
            <p>Indirect recursion is a function or method calls another function or method, which in turn calls the original function or method. This creates a cyclic dependency between the functions, forming a loop-like structure.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Call Stack</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A call stack is a data structure used by computer programs to keep track of function calls. When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack. This frame contains information about the function call, such as the <b>function arguments</b> and the <b>current position</b> in the code. When the function completes its execution, the frame is removed from the call stack, and the program returns to the previous frame.
            <br><br>The call stack operates in a <b>Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)</b> manner, which means that the last function called is the first to be completed. This is important to keep in mind when dealing with recursive functions, as each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow errors if not managed properly.</p><br><br>

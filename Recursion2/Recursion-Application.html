            <h1>Applications of Recursion</h1><br>
            <div class="application">
            
            <h2>Data Structures</h2> 
            <p>
              
                Recursion is widely used in various data structures for traversal and manipulation, including:<br>
                
                a. Binary Tree Traversal<br>
                Binary trees are naturally recursive data structures, making them ideal for recursive algorithms.<br> You can perform <b>in-order, pre-order</b>, and <b>post-order</b> traversal using recursion.
            </p>
            <p>b. Graph Algorithms (DFS)<br>
                Depth-First Search (DFS) is a recursive graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.<br>
                 DFS is used in finding connected components in a graph, solving puzzles like mazes, detecting cycles in a graph, and more.</p>

            <p>c. Divide and Conquer Algorithms<br>
                Recursion is an essential part of divide and conquer algorithms, which break a problem down into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine their solutions.</p>

            <h2>Parsing Expressions</h2>
            <p>Recursion is frequently used in parsing expressions (such as mathematical expressions or programming language syntax) to break down complex expressions into simpler ones. This is foundational in compilers, interpreters, and calculators.<br><br>

                For Example:<br>
                Parsing mathematical expressions like 3 + 5 * (2 - 8).<br>
                Compilers use recursive descent parsers to analyze the syntax of programming languages, transforming high-level code into lower-level machine code.</p>

            <h2> File and Directory Traversal</h2>
              <p> Recursion is particularly useful in navigating file systems because directories can contain subdirectories, which in turn can contain more subdirectories, creating a tree-like structure.<br><br>
                
                Use Case: <br>Traversing and searching through a file directory system.<br>
                Searching for files with a specific extension (e.g., ".txt").<br>
                Calculating the total size of a directory by summing the sizes of all its files and subdirectories.</p>

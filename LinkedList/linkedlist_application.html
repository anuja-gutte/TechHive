  <h3>Applications of Linked Lists in Computer Science</h3>

  <section class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Implementation of Stacks and Queues:</strong> 
        Linked lists are often used to implement dynamic stacks (Last-In-First-Out) and queues (First-In-First-Out). They enable flexible memory usage because the size of the stack or queue can change dynamically as elements are added or removed.
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Graph Representation:</strong> 
        In graph data structures, linked lists are used to represent adjacency lists. Each vertex of the graph can be associated with a linked list that stores adjacent vertices. This representation is space-efficient for sparse graphs and plays a key role in traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
      </li>

      <li><strong>3. Dynamic Memory Allocation:</strong> 
        Linked lists are used for dynamic memory allocation in operating systems. Memory blocks, or "chunks," are stored as nodes, making it easier to manage free memory, particularly in scenarios like heap memory allocation.
      </li>

      <li><strong>4. Directory Management:</strong> 
        In some file systems, linked lists are used to represent directory structures, where directories and files are treated as nodes. This allows for easy navigation through directories and efficient file handling.
      </li>

      <li><strong>5. Undo/Redo Operations:</strong> 
        Many applications, such as text editors and design tools, implement undo/redo functionality using linked lists. Each state or action is stored as a node, and navigating forward and backward through the list allows users to undo or redo actions seamlessly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Applications of Linked Lists in the Real World</h3>

  <section class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Image Viewer:</strong> 
        Image viewers use linked lists to allow users to navigate between images with "previous" and "next" buttons. Each image is stored as a node, and the viewer can easily load the next or previous image from the list.
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Web Browsers:</strong> 
        Web browsers maintain a linked list of previously visited pages, allowing users to move back and forth in their browsing history. This makes navigation smooth and intuitive.
      </li>

      <li><strong>3. Music Players:</strong> 
        In music players, linked lists store playlists where each song is a node. Users can navigate between songs, and operations like shuffle and repeat can be implemented by traversing the linked list.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Applications of Circular Linked Lists</h3>

  <section class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Task Scheduling:</strong> 
        Circular linked lists are often used in operating systems for round-robin scheduling. Each process is represented as a node, and the scheduler moves through the list in a circular fashion, ensuring each process gets an equal share of CPU time.
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Multiplayer Games:</strong> 
        Circular linked lists are used to manage player turns in multiplayer games. Each player is represented as a node, and the game passes turns in a cyclic manner, returning to the first player after the last player has played.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Applications of Doubly Linked Lists</h3>

  <section class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Browser Cache:</strong> 
        Web browsers often use doubly linked lists to manage the cache of web pages. The forward and backward navigation buttons allow users to move between cached pages efficiently, with each page being a node connected in both directions.
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Undo/Redo Functionality:</strong> 
        Text editors and other applications use doubly linked lists to manage undo/redo operations. Each edit is stored as a node, and users can move both backward (undo) and forward (redo) through the editing history.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Examples of Linked Lists</h3>

  <section class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Singly Linked List:</strong> 
        A singly linked list allows traversal in one direction only, where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Doubly Linked List:</strong> 
        A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions, where each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
      </li>

      <li><strong>3. Circular Linked List:</strong> 
        A circular linked list connects the last node back to the first node, forming a continuous loop. This structure is useful for certain applications like round-robin scheduling.
      </li>

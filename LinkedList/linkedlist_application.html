        <h1>Applications of Linked Lists</h1><br>
        <div class="application">
            <h2>Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in many different areas of computer science, including:<br>

                a. Implementation of Stacks and Queues<br>
                Linked lists are commonly used to implement dynamic stacks (Last-In-First-Out) and queues (First-In-First-Out). These implementations allow the structure to grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.<br>
            </p>
            <p>b. Graph Representation<br>
                In graph data structures, linked lists are used to represent adjacency lists. Each vertex of a graph is associated with a linked list that stores adjacent vertices. This representation is particularly useful for implementing graph traversal algorithms such as BFS and DFS.</p>

            <p>c. Dynamic Memory Allocation<br>
                Linked lists are used in operating systems for dynamic memory allocation. Memory blocks are stored as nodes, making it easier to manage free memory, especially in systems with heap memory allocation.</p>

            <h2>File and Directory Management</h2>
            <p>
                In file systems, linked lists can be used to represent the directory structure, where directories and files are treated as nodes. This allows for efficient directory traversal and file handling.<br><br>

                Use Case:<br>
                Navigating through a file directory system.<br>
                Searching for files and subdirectories.<br>
                Representing directory contents in certain file systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Linked lists also find applications outside of computer science theory:<br><br>
                a. Image Viewers<br>
                Image viewers utilize linked lists to allow users to navigate between images using "next" and "previous" buttons. Each image is stored as a node in the list.<br><br>
                
                b. Web Browsers<br>
                Web browsers maintain a linked list of visited pages to allow easy navigation back and forth in the browsing history. This makes it convenient to return to previous or next pages.<br><br>

                c. Music Players<br>
                Music players often store playlists as linked lists, where each song is a node. Users can easily navigate through the list, and operations like shuffle and repeat can be implemented by traversing the linked list.
            </p>

            <h2>Examples of Linked Lists</h2>
            <p>
                There are various types of linked lists that are used for different applications:<br><br>
                a. Singly Linked List<br>
                A singly linked list allows traversal in only one direction, from the first node to the last. Each node points to the next node in the sequence.<br><br>

                b. Doubly Linked List<br>
                A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions, where each node points to both the next and the previous nodes. This is useful for applications that require back-and-forth navigation.<br><br>

                c. Circular Linked List<br>
                In a circular linked list, the last node is linked back to the first node, forming a continuous loop. This is particularly useful for certain scheduling algorithms and applications like round-robin task management.

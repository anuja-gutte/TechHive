        <h2>What is a Queue?</h2>
        <p>
          A queue is a linear list of elements in which deletions can take place
          only at one end called the front, and insertions can take place only
          at the end called the rear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The queue is a <strong>First In First Out (FIFO)</strong> type of data
          structure. The terms FRONT and REAR are used in describing a linear
          list only when it is implemented as a queue.

        <h3>Below are some key points about queues:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple Queue:</strong> Basic FIFO queue without any
            additional features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Circular Queue:</strong> A queue where the end of the queue
            wraps around to the beginning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Priority Queue:</strong> A queue where elements are dequeued
            based on priority rather than the order they were enqueued.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double-ended Queue (Deque):</strong> A queue where elements
            can be added or removed from both ends.
          </li>
        </ul>

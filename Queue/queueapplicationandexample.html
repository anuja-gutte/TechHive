        <h2>Applications of Queue</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Multi Programming:</strong> Multi programming means when
          multiple programs are running in the main memory. It is essential to
          organize these multiple programs, and these multiple programs are
          organized as queues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Network:</strong> In a network, a queue is used in devices
          such as a router or a switch. Another application of a queue is a mail
          queue, which is a directory that stores data and controls files for
          mail messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Job Scheduling:</strong> The computer has a task to execute a
          particular number of jobs that are scheduled to be executed one after
          another. These jobs are assigned to the processor one by one,
          organized using a queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shared Resources:</strong> Queues are used as waiting lists
          for a single shared resource.

        <h2>Example</h2>
            
            <p>Here are some examples of queue applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Printer Queue: Jobs are queued for printing in the order they are received.</li>
                <li>Task Scheduling: Tasks are executed based on their order in the queue.</li>
                <li>Call Center: Incoming calls are placed in a queue to be answered in order.</li>
                <li>Operating System: Processes waiting for CPU time are managed as queues.</li>
                <li>Web Server: Requests from users are queued to be processed sequentially.</li>
            </ul>

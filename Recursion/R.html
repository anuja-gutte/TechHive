        <p>
            Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is often used when a problem can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type. In a recursive function, there is usually a base case that stops the recursion and prevents an infinite loop.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-recursion-works">How Recursion Works</h2>
        <p>
            When a recursive function is called, it breaks down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call addresses a subproblem, and this continues until the base case is reached. The base case provides a simple, non-recursive solution that can be used to solve the smallest instances of the problem. After reaching the base case, the function returns its result, which is then used to resolve the larger instances of the problem.

            A classic example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It can be defined recursively as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            factorial(n) = 1, if n = 0
            factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1), if n > 0
        </pre>

        <h2 id="examples-of-recursion">Examples of Recursion</h2>
        <p>
            Some common examples of recursion include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Factorial Calculation</strong>: A factorial of a number can be calculated using a recursive function that multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one.</li>
            <li><strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong>: The Fibonacci sequence can be generated by a recursive function where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Tree Traversals</strong>: Recursive methods are commonly used to traverse trees, such as binary trees, by visiting each node and applying the same procedure to its children.</li>
            <li><strong>Towers of Hanoi</strong>: This classic problem involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. It is typically solved using recursion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="when-to-use-recursion">When to Use Recursion</h2>
        <p>
            Recursion is particularly useful when a problem can be naturally divided into similar subproblems. It provides a clear and concise solution for problems such as tree traversals, sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort, and graph traversal algorithms like depth-first search. However, recursion can lead to performance issues due to excessive memory usage and function call overhead if not used carefully. It is crucial to ensure that a base case is present and that each recursive call progresses towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
            While recursion can simplify the code and make it easier to understand, iterative solutions may sometimes be more efficient. It is essential to analyze the problem and decide whether recursion is the most appropriate solution.

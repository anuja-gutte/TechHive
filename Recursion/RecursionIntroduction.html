        <h2>Recursion</h2>
        <p>  Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is often used when a problem can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same type. In a recursive function, there is usually a base case that stops the recursion and prevents an infinite loop.</p>

        <h2>
            How Recursion Works
        </h2>
        <p>
            When a recursive function is called, it breaks down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem.
            <br> Each recursive call addresses a subproblem, and this continues until the base case is reached.<br><br> The base case provides a simple, non-recursive solution that can be used to solve the smallest instances of the problem.<br><br> After reaching the base case, the function returns its result, which is then used to resolve the larger instances of the problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Example Code</h2>
        <p>
            A classic example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It can be defined recursively as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
        <pre><code>
            factorial(n) = 1, if n = 0
            factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1), if n > 0

        
        </code></pre></div>

        <p>
            Some common examples of recursion include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Factorial Calculation</strong>: A factorial of a number can be calculated using a recursive function that multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong>: The Fibonacci sequence can be generated by a recursive function where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Tree Traversals</strong>: Recursive methods are commonly used to traverse trees, such as binary trees, by visiting each node and applying the same procedure to its children.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Towers of Hanoi</strong>: This classic problem involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. It is typically solved using recursion.</li>
        </ul>
